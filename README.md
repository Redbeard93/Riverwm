`#put-> export EDITOR='nvim' in /etc/profile.d/editor.sh`


2. Change keyboard layout:

I use halmak keyboard layout, for convenience, which is achieved by configuring us(dvorak) by hand(in my halmak repository).

if use bash, put these two lines in `/etc/environment`

```
XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT='us(basic)'
XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=ctrl:swapcaps
```

3. if you don`t have seatd & rely on logind(which is with linux by default) put this under /etc/environment 

check https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/656328/libseat-backend-seatd-c70-could-not-connect-to-socket-run-seatd-sock-no-su

`LIBSEAT_BACKEND=logind`

4. put 'river' at the bottom of `~/.bash_profile`

5. git clone all files from this repo & put them under `$HOME/.config/`

6. for IME, I use `fcitx5-im fcitx5-rime glfw-wayland`

7. To make  haikarainen/light work without sudo, add user to a secondary group----video group `sudo usermod -a -G video user`

8. To use bluetooth Headset, install `pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse bluez bluez-utils pavucontrol pamixer`  (in terms of using headphone plugin, in Pavucontrol interface, go to Configuration, select Pro Audio, restart applications, should be good to go (don`t know why it kind of work only that way))

9. To make vbetool work without sudo password, add `ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/vbetool` at the bottom line of `/etc/sudoers`

10. Hibernate settings(for example)

firstly, add `options resume=/dev/sdiJ`(wherever your swap disk is) in your (for example) systemd-boot bootloader such as 
`/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf`, then， configure the initramfs, add `resume` in `HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard modconf block filesystems fsck)` somewhere behind udev (mandatory), then run `sudo mkinitcpio -P`

(https://www.cnblogs.com/sztom/p/10612593.html)

11. To use OBS, install `qt5-wayland` `qt5ct` and `obs-studio`.to capture PC screen, install `xdg-desktop-portal` `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`, to use obs as vitual camera for example zoom stuff, install `v4l2loopback-dkms` and add user to video group(which happens at step 7.

add this to `~/.bash_profile`
```
# QT5 FIX
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"
# Wayland Fix
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM="wayland;xcb"
# export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=river
# export XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=river
# export XDG_CURRENT_SESION_TYPE=wayland
# export GDK_BACKEND="wayland,x11"
# export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
```

12. Gaming from `lutris`
       
       install `qt5-wayland qt6-wayland lib32-gtk2` first
       
       run yuzu with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb yuzu` (2022 yuzu doen`t support wayland yet)
       

    1. game on ps2 simulator(eg: the king of fighters 98 ultimate on sony ps2): download libs from 

       "https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/wiki/Installing-on-Linux#arch-linux" 
       
       then
    
       download `pcsx2` `lib32-gtk2` `qt6-wayland` and pcsx2 bios files from 
       
       "https://romsmania.cc/download/bios/pcsx2-playstation-2-bios-3"
    
    2. RedAlert2 problem solving: 
    
       Installation: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gInm74cTmW8&t=177s"

     > Installed CD-ROM (pre-origin era) version of Red Alert 2 + Yuri's Revenge
     > 
     > As mentioned in the comments and how-to above, changed ddraw load order, downloaded and used ddwrapper, changed ra2.ini config, ran the program on exclusive 32-bit wine with Windows XP version. Still encountered the black screen bug or disappearing menus.
     > 
     > Finally downloaded launcher from cncnet.org/.
     > Ran it in the same 32-bit wine prefix that I installed the game into.
     > Pointed the directory of the game.
     > Launcher downloaded some files/fixes and installed into the directory.
     > [Note - requires winetricks (for noobs like me) to install microsoft XNA 4.0 framework, DirectX 9-11, dotNETFramework 4.5.]
     > 
     > Launched the newly available CnCNetYRLauncher.exe in the game directory from wine.
     > Everything worked as it should.
     > Tried campaign, single player skirmish with 4 other opponents. No slow-downs.

    3.  How I can run stuff on xwayland
    
        just need to add QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb before the command to launch the program. You can add it before the program command in terminal for example         if you want that particular instance to run in xwayland.

        For more permanent solution, copy the application's shortcut from /usr/share/applications to $HOME/.local/applications, and add it in the Exec=           line. It would look like Exec=env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb program . Same can also be achieved by a menu editor if gui is more preferable 
        
        Or
        
        You can supposedly have the Exec= line be Exec=bash -c "source /opt/qt512/bin/qt512-env.sh && /opt/qt512/bin/yuzu" (assuming that latter path is         correct). Alternatively you can setup global environment variables by placing a file in /etc/profile.d/. Look at the existing ones in there for           examples; be sure to in that case append or prepend to LD_LIBRARY_PATH rather than replace it outright; something like export
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/qt512/lib so as to play nice with potential other packages that may want to do similar.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Solution for cannot exec yuzu runner in lutris under xwayland: write a bash script an make it executable
        
        write 
        
        ```
        
        #!/bin/bash

        QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb yuzu

        
        ```
        in yuzu-xwayland.sh then in terminal run command `chmod u+x yuzu-xwayland.sh`
